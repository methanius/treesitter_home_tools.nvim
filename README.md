# treesitter_home_tools.nvim
Neovim plugin with Treesitter-based functionality for my everyday coding tasks.

As I view this currently as only my personal code that is simply publicly hosted, expect very frequent breaking changes.

Currently houses a searching boolean toggler and a searching format-insensitive integer incrementer

Language support is comming as I need them or find the interest.
